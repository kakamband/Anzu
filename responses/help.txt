Anzu is available for the following commands:

1. (/schedule <deadline> <job_name>) to schedule your tasks
2. (/tasks) to show all available tasks
3. (/delete <job_name>) to delete available tasks in this room
4. (/help) to spawn the help menu
5. (/leave) to make me leave (if on a group or multi-chat environment)

As a note, you can use me by inviting me to a group, a room, or by just simply messaging me! The commands are compatible with each other!
